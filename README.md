## Database 
For sample purpose, h2 database(local database) is integrated with the application so that application can run for any user.<br>
If user want to change the database, they can make relevant changes in "application.properties" file.<br>
Also, some data is pre-populated for sample purpose<br>
## Sample data
* All are below information are for sample purpose.
* Four movies are activated in four theatres with four shows for the current day only. Program is auto-scheduled for this.  
* If current timing exceeds any show timing's end time, then status is changed to completed and hence,ticket cannot be booked for such shows..
* If current timing exceeds any show timing's start time but not end time , then that show is running and hence,ticket cannot be booked for such shows.
* This information is just for smooth usage. Everything is validated, no worry for the users.
This is enough for sample purpose.
